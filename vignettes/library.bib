	abstract = {Coastal wetlands are sites of rapid carbon (C) sequestration and contain large soil C stocks. Thus, there is increasing interest in those ecosystems as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset projects (sometimes referred to as “Blue Carbon”), through preservation of existing C stocks or creation of new wetlands to increase future sequestration. Here we show that in the globally-widespread occurrence of diked, impounded, drained and tidally-restricted salt marshes, substantial methane ({CH}4) and {CO}2 emission reductions can be achieved through restoration of disconnected saline tidal flows. Modeled climatic forcing indicates that tidal restoration to reduce emissions has a much greater impact per unit area than wetland creation or conservation to enhance sequestration. Given that {GHG} emissions in tidally-restricted, degraded wetlands are caused by human activity, they are anthropogenic emissions, and reducing them will have an effect on climate that is equivalent to reduced emission of an equal quantity of fossil fuel {GHG}. Thus, as a landuse-based climate change intervention, reducing {CH}4 emissions is an entirely distinct concept from biological C sequestration projects to enhance C storage in forest or wetland biomass or soil, and will not suffer from the non-permanence risk that stored C will be returned to the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify “natural climate solutions” ({NCS}): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of {NCS}—when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation—is 23.8 petagrams of {CO}2 equivalent ({PgCO}2e) y−1 (95\% {CI} 20.3–37.4). This is ≥30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 {PgCO}2e y−1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of {CO}2 pollution is ≥100 {USD} {MgCO}2e−1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective {CO}2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a {\textgreater}66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective {NCS} mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 {USD} {MgCO}2−1. Most {NCS} actions—if effectively implemented—also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of {NCS} mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.},

We illustrate that most wetlands, when carbon sequestration is compared to methane emissions, do not have 25 times more {CO}2 sequestration than methane emissions; therefore, to many landscape managers and non specialists, most wetlands would be considered by some to be sources of climate warming or net radiative forcing. We show by dynamic modeling of carbon flux results from seven detailed studies by us of temperate and tropical wetlands and from 14 other wetland studies by others that methane emissions become unimportant within 300 years compared to carbon sequestration in wetlands. Within that time frame or less, most wetlands become both net carbon and radiative sinks. Furthermore, we estimate that the world’s wetlands, despite being only about 5–8 \% of the terrestrial landscape, may currently be net carbon sinks of about 830 Tg/year of carbon with an average of 118 g-C m−2 year−1 of net carbon retention. Most of that carbon retention occurs in tropical/subtropical wetlands. We demonstrate that almost all wetlands are net radiative sinks when balancing carbon sequestration and methane emissions and conclude that wetlands can be created and restored to provide C sequestration and other ecosystem services without great concern of creating net radiative sources on the climate due to methane emissions.},

We used published and unpublished field data to investigate the relationships between tidal marsh methane emissions, salinity, and porewater concentrations of methane and sulfate, then used these relationships to consider the balance between methane emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Polyhaline tidal marshes (salinity {\textgreater}18) had significantly lower methane emissions (mean ± sd = 1 ± 2 g m−2 yr−1) than other marshes, and can be expected to decrease radiative forcing when created or restored. There was no significant difference in methane emissions from fresh (salinity = 0–0.5) and mesohaline (5–18) marshes (42 ± 76 and 16 ± 11 g m−2 yr−1, respectively), while oligohaline (0.5–5) marshes had the highest and most variable methane emissions (150 ± 221 g m−2 yr−1). Annual methane emissions were modeled using a linear fit of salinity against log-transformed methane flux (log({CH}4)=−0.056×salinity +1.38loga({CH}4)=−0.056×salinity +1.38 {\textbackslash}log (\{{\textbackslash}text\{C\}\}\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{H\}\}\_4\}) = - 0.056 {\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}text\{salinity \}\} + \{ 1\}\{.38\} ; r2 = 0.52; p {\textless} 0.0001).

	abstract = {For decades, ecosystem scientists have used global warming potentials ({GWPs}) to compare the radiative forcing of various greenhouse gases to determine if ecosystems have a net warming or cooling effect on climate. On a conceptual basis, the continued use of {GWPs} by the ecological community may be untenable because the use of {GWPs} requires the implicit assumption that greenhouse gas emissions occur as a single pulse; this assumption is rarely justified in ecosystem studies. We present two alternate metrics—the sustained-flux global warming potential ({SGWP}, for gas emissions) and the sustained-flux global cooling potential ({SGCP}, for gas uptake)—for use when gas fluxes persist over time. The {SGWP} is generally larger than the {GWP} (by up to {\textasciitilde}40\%) for both methane and nitrous oxide emissions, creating situations where the {GWP} and {SGWP} metrics could provide opposing interpretations about the climatic role of an ecosystem. Further, there is an asymmetry in methane and nitrous oxide dynamics between persistent emission and uptake situations, producing very different values for the {SGWP} vs. {SGCP} and leading to the conclusion that ecosystems that take up these gases are very effective at reducing radiative forcing. Although the new metrics are more realistic than the {GWP} for ecosystem fluxes, we further argue that even these metrics may be insufficient in the context of trying to understand the lifetime climatic role of an ecosystem. A dynamic modeling approach that has the flexibility to account for temporally variable rates of greenhouse gas exchange, and is not limited by a fixed time frame, may be more informative than the {SGWP}, {SGCP}, or {GWP}. Ultimately, we hope this article will stimulate discussion within the ecosystem science community about the most appropriate way(s) of assessing the role of ecosystems as regulators of global climate.},

	abstract = {Coastal marshes take up atmospheric {CO}2 while emitting {CO}2, {CH}4, and N2O. This ability to sequester carbon (C) is much greater for wetlands on a per area basis than from most ecosystems, facilitating scientific, political, and economic interest in their value as greenhouse gas sinks. However, the greenhouse gas balance of Gulf of Mexico wetlands is particularly understudied. We describe the net ecosystem exchange ({NEEc}) of {CO}2 and {CH}4 using eddy covariance ({EC}) in comparison with fluxes of {CO}2, {CH}4, and N2O using chambers from brackish and freshwater marshes in Louisiana, {USA}. From {EC}, we found that 182 g C m−2 yr−1 was lost through {NEEc} from the brackish marsh. Of this, 11 g C m−2 yr−1 resulted from net {CH}4 emissions and the remaining 171 g C m−2 yr−1 resulted from net {CO}2 emissions. In contrast, −290 g C m2 yr−1 was taken up through {NEEc} by the freshwater marsh, with 47 g C m−2 yr−1 emitted as {CH}4 and −337 g C m−2 yr−1 taken up as {CO}2. From chambers, we discovered that neither site had large fluxes of N2O. Sustained-flux greenhouse gas accounting metrics indicated that both marshes had a positive (warming) radiative balance, with the brackish marsh having a substantially greater warming effect than the freshwater marsh. That net respiratory emissions of {CO}2 and {CH}4 as estimated through chamber techniques were 2–4 times different from emissions estimated through {EC} requires additional understanding of the artifacts created by different spatial and temporal sampling footprints between techniques.},

	abstract = {Abstract Wetlands are the largest source of methane ({CH}4) globally, yet our understanding of how process?level controls scale to ecosystem fluxes remains limited. It is particularly uncertain how variable soil properties influence ecosystem {CH}4 emissions on annual time scales. We measured ecosystem carbon dioxide ({CO}2) and {CH}4 fluxes by eddy covariance from two wetlands recently restored on peat and alluvium soils within the Sacramento?San Joaquin Delta of California. Annual {CH}4 fluxes from the alluvium wetland were significantly lower than the peat site for multiple years following restoration, but these differences were not explained by variation in dominant climate drivers or productivity across wetlands. Soil iron (Fe) concentrations were significantly higher in alluvium soils, and alluvium {CH}4 fluxes were decoupled from plant processes compared with the peat site, as expected when Fe reduction inhibits {CH}4 production in the rhizosphere. Soil carbon content and {CO}2 uptake rates did not vary across wetlands and, thus, could also be ruled out as drivers of initial {CH}4 flux differences. Differences in wetland {CH}4 fluxes across soil types were transient; alluvium wetland fluxes were similar to peat wetland fluxes 3 years after restoration. Changing alluvium {CH}4 emissions with time could not be explained by an empirical model based on dominant {CH}4 flux biophysical drivers, suggesting that other factors, not measured by our eddy covariance towers, were responsible for these changes. Recently accreted alluvium soils were less acidic and contained more reduced Fe compared with the pre?restoration parent soils, suggesting that {CH}4 emissions increased as conditions became more favorable to methanogenesis within wetland sediments. This study suggests that alluvium soil properties, likely Fe content, are capable of inhibiting ecosystem?scale wetland {CH}4 flux, but these effects appear to be transient without continued input of alluvium to wetland sediments.},

	abstract = {Drained peat soils are a significant source of greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions to the atmosphere. Rewetting these soils is considered an important climate change mitigation tool to reduce emissions and create suitable conditions for carbon sequestration. Long-term monitoring is essential to capture interannual variations in {GHG} emissions and associated environmental variables and to reduce the uncertainty linked with {GHG} emission factor calculations. In this study, we present {GHG} balances: carbon dioxide ({CO}2), methane ({CH}4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) calculated for a 5-year period at a rewetted industrial cutaway peatland in Ireland (rewetted 7 years prior to the start of the study); and compare the results with an adjacent drained area (2-year data set), and with ten long-term data sets from intact (i.e. undrained) peatlands in temperate and boreal regions. In the rewetted site, {CO}2 exchange (or net ecosystem exchange ({NEE})) was strongly influenced by ecosystem respiration (Reco) rather than gross primary production ({GPP}). {CH}4 emissions were related to soil temperature and either water table level or plant biomass. N2O emissions were not detected in either drained or rewetted sites. Rewetting reduced {CO}2 emissions in unvegetated areas by approximately 50\%. When upscaled to the ecosystem level, the emission factors (calculated as 5-year mean of annual balances) for the rewetted site were (±{SD}) −104 ± 80 g {CO}2-C m−2 yr−1 (i.e. {CO}2 sink) and 9 ± 2 g {CH}4-C m−2 yr−1 (i.e. {CH}4 source). Nearly a decade after rewetting, the {GHG} balance (100-year global warming potential) had reduced noticeably (i.e. less warming) in comparison with the drained site but was still higher than comparative intact sites. Our results indicate that rewetted sites may be more sensitive to interannual changes in weather conditions than their more resilient intact counterparts and may switch from an annual {CO}2 sink to a source if triggered by slightly drier conditions.},

There is growing interest in financing wetland restoration using C markets; however, this requires careful accounting of both {CO}2 and {CH}4 exchange at the ecosystem scale. Here we present a new model, the {PEPRMT} model (Peatland Ecosystem Photosynthesis Respiration and Methane Transport), which consists of a hierarchy of biogeochemical models designed to estimate {CO}2 and {CH}4 exchange in restored managed wetlands. Empirical models using temperature and/or photosynthesis to predict respiration and {CH}4 production were contrasted with a more process-based model that simulated substrate-limited respiration and {CH}4 production using multiple carbon pools. Models were parameterized by using a model-data fusion approach with multiple years of eddy covariance data collected in a recently restored wetland and a mature restored wetland. A third recently restored wetland site was used for model validation. During model validation, the process-based model explained 70\% of the variance in net ecosystem exchange of {CO}2 ({NEE}) and 50\% of the variance in {CH}4 exchange. Not accounting for high respiration following restoration led to empirical models overestimating annual {NEE} by 33–51\%. By employing a model-data fusion approach we provide rigorous estimates of uncertainty in model predictions, accounting for uncertainty in data, model parameters, and model structure. The {PEPRMT} model is a valuable tool for understanding carbon cycling in restored wetlands and for application in carbon market-funded wetland restoration, thereby advancing opportunity to counteract the vast degradation of wetlands and flooded peatlands.},

	abstract = {Wetlands play a disproportionately large role in global terrestrial carbon stocks, and from 1 year to the next individual wetlands can fluctuate between carbon sinks and sources depending on factors such as hydrology, temperature, and land use. Although much research has been done on short-term seasonal to annual wetland biogeochemical cycles, there is a lack of experimental evidence concerning how the reversibility of wetland hydrological changes will influence these cycles over longer time periods. Five years of drought-induced declining water table at Lost Creek, a shrub fen wetland in northern Wisconsin, coincided with increased ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production ({GPP}) as derived from long-term eddy covariance observations. Since then, however, the average water table level at this site has increased, providing a unique opportunity to explore how wetland carbon fluxes are affected by interannual air temperature differences as well as changing water table levels. Water table level, as measured by water discharge, was correlated with Reco and {GPP} at interannual time scales. However, air temperature had a strong correlation with Reco, {GPP}, and net ecosystem productivity ({NEP}) at monthly time scales and correlated with {NEP} at inter-annual time scales. Methane flux was strongly temperature-controlled at seasonal time scales, increasing an order of magnitude from April to July. Annual methane emissions were 51 g C m−2. Our results demonstrate that over multi-year timescales, water table fluctuations can have limited effects on wetland net carbon fluxes and instead at Lost Creek annual temperature is the best predictor of interannual variation.},

Network statistics are used to measure the statistical feedback, entropy, and net and gross information production of subsystems on the network to study monthly process networks for a Midwestern corn-soybean ecosystem for the years 1998–2006. Several distinct system states are identified and characterized. Particularly interesting is the midsummer state that is dominated by regional-scale information feedback and by information flow originating from the ecosystem's photosynthetic activity. In this state, information flows both “top-down” from synoptic weather systems and “bottom-up” from the plant photosynthetic activity. A threshold in air temperature separates this summer state where increased organization appears from other system states. The relationship between Shannon entropy and information flow is investigated. It is found that information generally flows from high-entropy variables to low-entropy variables, and moderate-entropy variables participate in feedback.},

	abstract = {Ecohydrological systems may be characterized as nonlinear, complex, open dissipative systems. Such systems consist of many coupled processes, and the couplings change depending on the system state or scale in space and time at which the system is analyzed. The arrangement of couplings in a complex system may be represented as a network of information flow and feedback between variables that measure system processes. The occurrence of feedback on such a network provides sufficient conditions for self-organized and nonlinear behaviors to emerge. We adapt an information-theoretic statistical method called transfer entropy for the purposes of robustly measuring the directionality, relative strength, statistical significance, and time scale of information flow between pairs of ecohydrological variables using time series data. A process network may be delineated where variables are cast as nodes and information flows as weighted directional links between them. The process network captures key couplings and time scales and represents the state of the complex system as a whole, including functional groups of variables (subsystems) and synchronization resulting from feedbacks. It is therefore able to identify interactions which are not detectable using methods which examine the system using one relationship at a time. We assemble an information flow process network using July 2003 {FLUXNET} data for a Midwestern corn-soybean ecohydrological system in a healthy, peak growing season state and compare the results with those using July 2005 data for the same site during a severe drought. We find that the process network during drought is substantially decoupled, and regional-scale information feedback is reduced during the drought. We conclude that the proposed process network methodology is able to identify the differences between two states of an ecohydrological system on the basis of variations in the pattern of feedback coupling on the network.},

	abstract = {Methane ({CH}4) exchange in wetlands is complex, involving nonlinear asynchronous processes across diverse time scales. These processes and time scales are poorly characterized at the whole-ecosystem level, yet are crucial for accurate representation of {CH}4 exchange in process models. We used a combination of wavelet analysis and information theory to analyze interactions between whole-ecosystem {CH}4 flux and biophysical drivers in two restored wetlands of Northern California from hourly to seasonal time scales, explicitly questioning assumptions of linear, synchronous, single-scale analysis. Although seasonal variability in {CH}4 exchange was dominantly and synchronously controlled by soil temperature, water table fluctuations, and plant activity were important synchronous and asynchronous controls at shorter time scales that propagated to the seasonal scale. Intermittent, subsurface water table decline promoted short-term pulses of methane emission but ultimately decreased seasonal {CH}4 emission through subsequent inhibition after rewetting. Methane efflux also shared information with evapotranspiration from hourly to multiday scales and the strength and timing of hourly and diel interactions suggested the strong importance of internal gas transport in regulating short-term emission. Traditional linear correlation analysis was generally capable of capturing the major diel and seasonal relationships, but mesoscale, asynchronous interactions and nonlinear, cross-scale effects were unresolved yet important for a deeper understanding of methane flux dynamics. We encourage wider use of these methods to aid interpretation and modeling of long-term continuous measurements of trace gas and energy exchange.},

These measures of proximate nutrient limitation fail to account for the gradual changes in biogeochemical nutrient cycles and nutrient fluxes from sediments, and succession of communities that are important components of whole-ecosystem responses. Erroneous assumptions about ecosystem processes and lack of accounting for hysteresis during lake recovery have further confused management of eutrophication. I conclude that long-term, whole-ecosystem experiments and case histories of lake recovery provide the only reliable evidence for policies to reduce eutrophication. The only method that has had proven success in reducing the eutrophication of lakes is reducing input of phosphorus. There are no case histories or long-term ecosystem-scale experiments to support recent claims that to reduce eutrophication of lakes, nitrogen must be controlled instead of or in addition to phosphorus. Before expensive policies to reduce nitrogen input are implemented, they require ecosystem-scale verification. The recent claim that the ‘phosphorus paradigm’ for recovering lakes from eutrophication has been ‘eroded’ has no basis. Instead, the case for phosphorus control has been strengthened by numerous case histories and large-scale experiments spanning several decades.},

Poorly supported management can have detrimental, costly or irreversible impacts on the environment and society. Here, we examine common issues in ecological modelling and suggest criteria for improving modelling frameworks. An appropriate level of process description is crucial to constructing the best possible model, given the available data and understanding of ecological structures. Model details unsupported by data typically lead to over parameterisation and poor model performance. Conversely, a lack of mechanistic details may limit a model's ability to predict ecological systems? responses to management. Ecological studies that employ models should follow a set of model adequacy assessment protocols that include: asking a series of critical questions regarding state and control variable selection, the determinacy of data, and the sensitivity and validity of analyses. We also need to improve model elaboration, refinement and coarse graining procedures to better understand the relevancy and adequacy of our models and the role they play in advancing theory, improving hind and forecasting, and enabling problem solving and management.},

	abstract = {Advances in computing technology, new and ongoing restoration initiatives, concerns about climate change's effects, and the increasing interdisciplinarity of research have encouraged the development of landscape-scale mechanistic models of coupled ecological-geophysical systems. However, communication barriers and uneven infiltration of new strategies for data-driven induction persist in the context of simulation model development across disciplines. One challenge is that ecology and the geosciences have embraced different modeling epistemologies, with ecologists historically favoring inductive inference from generalized, phenomenological models and geoscientists favoring deductive inference from detailed first-principles models. Today, many models used for environmental management, particularly for aquatic ecosystems, tend to be highly detailed, with ecological and geophysical components represented in different modules that are linked but often not closely integrated. These observations highlight a need for cross-disciplinary dialogue about landscape-scale modeling objectives and approaches. The philosophies of pattern-oriented modeling in ecology and exploratory modeling in geophysics have yielded advances in theoretical and applied knowledge in both of those disciplines, but they are not comprehensive across all aspects of landscape-scale modeling. Here we define and synthesize the “Appropriate-Complexity Method” ({ACME}), which builds upon these two philosophies to guide the development of process-oriented models across a spectrum of scientific and management objectives. {ACME} helps modelers efficiently converge upon an optimal modeling structure through: i) systematic evaluation of the attributes that comprise computational and representational detail, for which we have developed an operational decision tree; ii) iterative adjustment of models based on pattern-oriented model evaluation strategies; and iii) the use of appropriate datasets (where applicable) to build conceptual models and formulate predictions. Decisions about aspects of computational and representational detail are based on the landscape's emergent properties. They are also based on a hierarchy of classes of questions governing model objectives that represent a multi-attribute tradeoff among validation potential, interpretability, tractability, and generality as functions of computational and representational detail. Tradeoff curves, together with model objectives, provide further guidance for determining the “appropriate” level of complexity for representation of processes in models. Once deemed adequate for addressing the original research question of interest, models may be used for projection and scenario testing. They may next undergo expansion that moves them down the hierarchy, where they can then be used to address research questions of higher specificity, detail, and validation potential, though at a cost of lower tractability and interpretability on the tradeoff curves. This practical, systematic procedure provides clear guidance for the design and improvement of landscape models that may be used to address a wide variety of questions relevant to restoration, over a spectrum of scales.},

	abstract = {While the concept of connectivity has gained popularity in fields like hydrology and ecology, little agreement exists on its definition, which hinders its use in both scientific and legal contexts. In contrast, neuroscientists have developed not only strong conceptualizations of connectivity but also tools to quantify it: a clear distinction is made between structural connectivity, which is determined from brain anatomy; functional connectivity, which is estimated based on statistical dependencies between neuronal electric timeseries; and effective connectivity, which infers causal relations from the same timeseries based on the assumption that “true” interactions occur with a certain time delay. The motivation of this review arose from the hypothesis that connectivity-related statistical techniques, which are applied to timeseries of electrical currents measured by placing electrodes on the scalp of the human brain, could also apply to high-frequency hydrological timeseries acquired to characterize catchment response to precipitation. Here we bring together existing conceptualizations of structural, functional and effective connectivity in hydrology and ecology and compare them with those used in brain neuroscience. We then summarize the most important brain connectivity measures and their associated mathematical frameworks before evaluating the potential of those measures to help advance our understanding of hydrologic connectivity properties – in terms of the frequency, magnitude, timing, duration and rate of water movement linking two disparate locations. Lastly, we present a short case study where a selection of brain connectivity measures is applied to 35 groundwater and streamflow timeseries from a Swiss catchment to infer subsurface flow-driven hydrologic connectivity. Our literature review combined with our short case study suggest that an ensemble of functional and effective connectivity measures should be used and constrained not only by structural connectivity measures but also by interpretation thresholds in order to make results parsimonious. We highlight challenges associated with transferring brain connectivity measures to hydrology, especially those related to choosing the appropriate length and sampling frequency of input timeseries when assessing perennial versus ephemeral connectivity, appropriately detecting and differentiating noisy from indirect connections, and interpreting unbounded connectivity measures. We then offer recommendations for future research and propose that hydrologists use a common classification system encompassing all potential connectivity assessment approaches and measures in order to facilitate scientific communication.},

Based on the relative mutual information between {NEE} and biophysical variables, this was driven by a combination of higher water table depth ({WTD}), cooler air temperature, and lower vapor pressure deficit ({VPD}) during spring tides relative to neap tides, as the fortnightly tidal cycle not only influenced water levels but also strongly modulated water and air temperature and {VPD}. Tides also influenced {NEE} at shorter timescales, with a reduction in nighttime fluxes during growing season spring tides when the higher of the two semidiurnal tides caused inundation at the site. {WTD} significantly influenced ecosystem respiration (Reco), with lower Reco during spring tides than neap tides. While {WTD} did not appear to affect ecosystem photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, {GPP}) directly, the impact of tides on temperature and {VPD} influenced {GPP}, with higher daily light?use efficiency and photosynthetic activity during spring tides than neap tides when temperature and {VPD} were lower. The strong direct and indirect influence of tides on {NEE} across the diel and multiday timescales has important implications for modeling {NEE} in tidal wetlands and can help inform the timing and frequency of chamber measurements as annual or seasonal net {CO}2 uptake may be underestimated if measurements are only taken during nonflooded periods.},

Inferring causality from measured ecological variables sampled through time remains a formidable challenge further made difficult by the action of periodic drivers overlapping the natural dynamics of the system. Periodicity in the drivers can often mask the self-sustained oscillations originating from the autonomous dynamics. While linear and direct causal relationships are commonly addressed in the time domain, using the well-established machinery of Granger causality (G-causality), the presence of periodic forcing requires frequency-based statistics (e.g., the Fourier transform), able to distinguish coupling induced by oscillations in external drivers from genuine endogenous interactions. Recent nonparametric spectral extensions of G-causality to the frequency domain pave the way for the scale-by-scale decomposition of causality, which can improve our ability to link oscillatory behaviors of ecological networks to causal mechanisms. The performance of both spectral G-causality and its conditional extension for multivariate systems is explored in quantifying causal interactions within ecological networks. Through two case studies involving synthetic and actual time series, it is demonstrated that conditional G-causality outperforms standard G-causality in identifying causal links and their concomitant timescales.},

Here we make direct landscape-scale measurements of carbon dioxide and {CH}4 fluxes and show that gross ecosystem photosynthesis ({GEP}) is the dominant cause of the diurnal pattern in {CH}4 flux, even after accounting for the effects of soil temperature. The time series of {GEP} and {CH}4 flux show strong spectral coherency throughout the rice growing season at the diurnal timescale, where the peak in {GEP} leads that of {CH}4 flux by 1.3 ± 0.08 hours.

While it has been recognized that the two concepts must be related, the exact relationship has until now not been formally described. Here we show that for Gaussian variables, Granger causality and transfer entropy are entirely equivalent, thus bridging autoregressive and information-theoretic approaches to data-driven causal inference.},

Here, we combine long?term with synoptic sampling of metabolism and its variable controls in neighboring watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay to resolve limiting factors and critical timescales associated with recovery from disturbance. We found that, relative to predictions of the river continuum concept, focal streams have ?disrupted? carbon cycles, with carbon balances closer to zero, and, in some cases, tighter coupling between gross primary production ({GPP}) and ecosystem respiration ({ER}), attributable to carbon limitation. Carbon became limiting to {ER} where flashy storm hydrographs and simplified channel geomorphology inhibited accumulation of fine sediment. Shannon entropy analysis of timescales revealed that fine sediment served as a time?release capsule for nutrients and carbon over 4?6 months, fueling biogeochemical transformations. Loss of fines through hydraulic disturbance had up to 30?d impacts on {GPP} and 50?d impacts on {ER} in the stream with carbon limitation. In contrast, where {GPP} and {ER} were not tightly coupled, recovery occurred within 1 d. Results suggest that a complex interplay between nutrient and carbon limitation and mechanical and chemical disturbance governs patterns and consequences of disrupted carbon cycling in urban streams. Carbon limitation and tight {GPP}/{ER} coupling enhance the vulnerability of stream ecosystem functions, but best management practices that target stormflow reduction and channel geomorphic diversity can break that coupling and minimize carbon cycle disruptions.},

In this study, we determined the effects of the 1997–1998 {ENSO}-related drought on the hydrology and salinity of a Micronesian mangrove ecosystem and an adjacent freshwater swamp. A network of 9 piezometer clusters installed at the study site served as sampling points for continuous and manual measurements of salinity and water level. During the drought period from January through April 1998, mean water table levels in the mangroves and freshwater swamp were approximately 12 and 54 cm lower, respectively, than during May through December when precipitation returned to near normal levels. At the peak of the drought (February 1998), the most dramatic result was a reversal in groundwater flow that sent groundwater from the mangroves upstream toward the freshwater swamp. Flow nets constructed for this period and immediately after illustrate the strong hydrological linkage between the two systems. This linkage was also illustrated by measurements of groundwater salinity in the piezometer network. Ninety-six percent of the salinity measurements taken in the mangroves during the study were at least 10‰ less than the salinity of sea water, indicating that the mangroves were consistently receiving freshwater flows. An analysis of variance of groundwater salinity measurements during and after the drought showed that salinity levels in the 0.5 and 1.0 m depth piezometers were greater during than after the drought. In a comparison of salinity values in 0.5-m wells during low tide, mean salinity was approximately twice as high during the drought than after (14.7‰ versus 6.2‰, respectively). This study demonstrates that short-term climate perturbations such as {ENSO} can disrupt important coastal processes. Over repeated drought cycles, such perturbations have the potential to affect the structure and function of mangrove forests and upstream ecosystems.},

The variability of hydrogeologic settings, three-dimensional distribution of saline water, and history of groundwater withdrawals and freshwater drainage has resulted in a variety of modes of saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers. These include lateral intrusion from the ocean; upward intrusion from deeper, more saline zones of a groundwater system; and downward intrusion from coastal waters. Saltwater contamination also has occurred along open boreholes and within abandoned, improperly constructed, or corroded wells that provide pathways for vertical migration across interconnected aquifers. Communities within the coastal regions of North America are taking actions to manage and prevent saltwater intrusion to ensure a sustainable source of groundwater for the future.

	abstract = {Abstract Semi?arid and arid regions (i.e. drylands with annual mean rainfall between 25 and 500 mm) cover approximately one?third of the world?s land area and are inhabited by almost 400 million people. Because they are a resource in short supply, waters in drylands are under increasing human pressures, and many are threatened by rising salinities (salinisation) in particular. Rising salinities result from several causes. The salinities of many large natural salt lakes in drylands are rising as water is diverted from their inflows for irrigation and other uses. The excessive clearance of natural, deep?rooted vegetation from catchments and the discharge of saline agricultural wastewater causes the salinity of many freshwater lakes, wetlands and rivers to rise. The salinisation of some fresh waters is caused by rising saline groundwaters. And in some regions, increasing climatic aridity may be a cause of salinisation. Whatever the cause, salinisation has significant economic, social and environmental impacts. They are usually deleterious and often irreparable. Decreased biodiversity, changes in the natural character of aquatic ecosystems, and lower productivity are frequent ecological effects. In some dryland countries, salinisation is viewed as the single most important threat to water resources. However, the extent and importance of salinisation as a global threat has been greatly underestimated. Recognition of this is the first step in any attempt to manage it effectively. The aims of the present paper, therefore, are three?fold. First, it aims to define the problem and indicate its extent; second, it aims to outline the causes and effects of salinisation; third, it aims to highlight the social, economic and environmental costs and comment on management responses. An overarching aim is to draw attention to the importance of salinisation as a phenomenon of global significance to waters in drylands.},

	abstract = {Abstract In arid/semi?arid environments, where rainfall is seasonal, highly variable and significantly less than the evaporation rate, groundwater discharge can be a major component of the water and salt balance of a wetland, and hence a major determinant of wetland ecology. Under natural conditions, wetlands in arid/semi?arid zones occasionally experience periods of higher salinity as a consequence of the high evaporative conditions and the variability of inflows which provide dilution and flushing of the stored salt. However, due to the impacts of human population pressure and the associated changes in land use, surface water regulation, and water resource depletion, wetlands in arid/semi?arid environments are now often experiencing extended periods of high salinity. This article reviews the current knowledge of the role that groundwater?surface water ({GW}?{SW}) interactions play in the ecology of arid/semi?arid wetlands. The key findings of the review are as follows: 1. {GW}?{SW} interactions in wetlands are highly dynamic, both temporally and spatially. Groundwater that is low in salinity has a beneficial impact on wetland ecology which can be diminished in dry periods when groundwater levels, and hence, inflows to wetlands are reduced or even cease. Conversely, if groundwater is saline, and inflows increase due to raised groundwater levels caused by factors such as land use change and river regulation, then this may have a detrimental impact on the ecology of a wetland and its surrounding areas. 2. {GW}?{SW} interactions in wetlands are mostly controlled by factors such as differences in head between the wetland surface water and groundwater, the local geomorphology of the wetland (in particular, the texture and chemistry of the wetland bed and banks), and the wetland and groundwater flow geometry. The {GW}?{SW} regime can be broadly classified into three types of flow regimes: (i) recharge?wetland loses surface water to the underlying aquifer; (ii) discharge?wetland gains water from the underlying aquifer; or (iii) flow?through?wetland gains water from the groundwater in some locations and loses it in others. However, it is important to note that individual wetlands may temporally change from one type to another depending on how the surface water levels in the wetland and the underlying groundwater levels change over time in response to climate, land use, and management. 3. The salinity in wetlands of arid/semi?arid environments will vary naturally due to high evaporative conditions, sporadic rainfall, groundwater inflows, and freshening after rains or floods. However, wetlands are often at particular risk of secondary salinity because their generally lower elevation in the landscape exposes them to increased saline groundwater inflows caused by rising water tables. Terminal wetlands are potentially at higher risk than flow?through systems as there is no salt removal mechanism. 4. Secondary salinity can impact on wetland biota through changes in both salinity and water regime, which result from the hydrological and hydrogeological changes associated with secondary salinity. Whilst there have been some detailed studies of these interactions for some Australian riparian tree species, the combined effects on aquatic biodiversity are only just beginning to be elucidated, and are therefore, a future research need. 5. Rainfall/flow?pulses, which are a well?recognized control on ecological function in arid/semi?arid areas, also play an important, though indirect, role through their impact on wetland salinity. Freshwater pulses can be the primary means by which salt stored in both the water column and the underlying sediments are flushed from wetlands. Conversely, increased runoff is also a commonly observed consequence of secondary salinity, and so, wetlands can experience increased surface water inflows that are higher in salinity than under natural conditions. Moreover, changes in rainfall/flow?pulse regimes can have a significant impact on wetland {GW}?{SW} interactions. It is possible that in some instances groundwater inflow to a wetland may become so heavy that it could become a major component of the water balance, and hence, mask the role of natural pulsing regimes. However, if the groundwater is low in salinity, this may provide an ecological benefit in arid/semi?arid areas by assisting in maintaining water in wetlands that become aquatic refugia between flow?pulses. 6. There has been almost no modelling of {GW}?{SW} interactions in arid/semi?arid wetlands with respect to water fluxes, let alone salinity or ecology. There is a clear need to develop modelling capabilities for the movement of salt to, from, and within wetlands to provide temporal predictions of wetland salinity which can be used to assess ecosystem outcomes. 7. There has been a concerted effort in Australia to collect and collate data on the salinity tolerance/sensitivity of freshwater aquatic biota and riparian vegetation. There are many shortcomings and knowledge gaps in these data, a fact recognized by many of the authors of this work. Particularly notable is that there is very little time?series data, which is a serious issue because wetland salinities are often highly temporally variable. There is also a concern that many of the data are from very controlled laboratory experiments, which may not represent the highly variable and unpredictable conditions experienced in the field. In light of these, and many other shortcomings identified, our view is that the data currently available are a useful guide but must be used with some caution.

A basic validation of the reference simulation along with a brief discussion of the surface climate changes for the A2 and B2 scenarios is also provided. Analysis of the changes in all three aridity measures indicates that by the end of the 21st century the Mediterranean region might experience a substantial increase in the northward extension of dry and arid lands, particularly in the central and southern portions of the Iberian, Italian, Hellenic and Turkish peninsulas and in areas of southeastern Europe (e.g. Romania and Bulgaria), the Middle East, northern Africa and major Islands (Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily). Most Ice-Cap areas of the Alps are also projected to disappear. These effects are due to a large warming and pronounced decrease in precipitation, especially during the spring and summer seasons. In addition, fine scale topography and coastline features affect the aridity change signal. We identify the southern Mediterranean as a region particularly vulnerable to water stress and desertification processes under climate change conditions.},

This paper first reviews and evaluates current and future social and environmental pressures on water resources, including climate change. The results show that pressures are not homogeneous across the region and sectors of water use. Second the paper evaluates the adaptation strategies to cope with water scarcity, including technology, use of strategic groundwater, and management.

	abstract = {The hydrologic transport of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) represents both a primary energetic loss from and a critical energetic link between ecosystems. Coastal freshwater wetlands serve as a primary source of {DOC} to estuaries; historically the magnitude and timing of {DOC} transfers has been driven by water movement. Extensive agricultural development throughout the coastal plain of the southeastern {US} has hydrologically connected much of the landscape via canals to facilitate drainage. The resulting large-scale loss of topographic relief and reduced mean elevation is interacting with increasingly frequent and severe droughts to facilitate the landward movement of seawater through the highly connected artificial drainage networks. The resulting changes in hydrologic regime and salinity are each expected to reduce {DOC} export from coastal freshwater wetlands, yet their individual and combined impacts are not well understood. Here we show that repeated saltwater incursion during late summer droughts substantially decreased {DOC} concentrations in surface water (from {\textasciitilde}40 to {\textasciitilde}18 mg/L) from a mature and a restored forested wetland in the coastal plain of North Carolina, {USA}. These declines in {DOC} concentration reduced annual export of {DOC} to the estuary by 70 \% and dampened storm fluxes by 76 \%. We used a long-term experiment with intact soil columns to measure the independent and combined effects of drought, salinity, and sulfate loading as potential drivers of the large changes in {DOC} concentration. We found that soil drying and salinization each reduced {DOC} similarly (20 \% reduction by drought alone, 29 \% by salinization) and their combined effect was additive (49 \% reduction in salinization + drought treatments). Our results demonstrate that, well in advance of significant sea-level rise, drought and relatively low levels of saltwater incursion ({\textless}6 ppt) are already significantly altering the timing and magnitude of dissolved organic carbon flux between coastal forested wetlands and downstream estuaries.},

Soil microbial communities respond quickly to salinity changes, altering the rate of soil organic carbon ({SOC}) loss and associated biogeochemical processes. This study quantified the impact of salinity-altering pulses on {SOC} loss, defined as microbial respiration ({CO}2 flux) at high and low tide, {CH}4 flux, and dissolved {OC} ({DOC}) release, in 3 intertidal wetlands (Jacksonville, {FL}, {USA}). Intact soil cores from a freshwater tidal, brackish, and salt marsh were exposed to simulated tides and 3 salinity pulsing events during a 53-day laboratory experiment. Soil and water physio-chemical properties, nutrient release, and microbial indicators were measured. Microbial respiration was the dominate pathway of {SOC} loss ({\textgreater}97 \%). Soil hydraulic conductivity was greater in brackish and salt marshes and was critical to overall soil respiration. High tide {CO}2 flux was greatest in the freshwater marsh (58 \% of {SOC} loss) and positively correlated with {DOC} concentration; low tide {CO}2 flux was greatest in brackish and salt marshes (62 and 70 \% of {SOC} loss, respectively) and correlated with {NH}4+ and microbial biomass. The freshwater marsh was sensitive to brackish pulses, causing a 112 \% increase in respiration, presumably from accelerated sulfate reduction and N-cycling. {SOC} loss increased in the salt marsh pulsed with freshwater, suggesting freshwater run-off may reduce a salt marsh’s ability to keep-pace with sea level rise. Increased inundation from storm surges could accelerate {SOC} loss in freshwater marshes, while decreasing {SOC} loss in brackish and salt marshes.},

	abstract = {Climate change-associated sea level rise is expected to cause saltwater intrusion into many historically freshwater ecosystems. Of particular concern are tidal freshwater wetlands, which perform several important ecological functions including carbon sequestration. To predict the impact of saltwater intrusion in these environments, we must first gain a better understanding of how salinity regulates decomposition in natural systems. This study sampled eight tidal wetlands ranging from freshwater to oligohaline (0–2 ppt) in four rivers near the Chesapeake Bay (Virginia). To help isolate salinity effects, sites were selected to be highly similar in terms of plant community composition and tidal influence. Overall, salinity was found to be strongly negatively correlated with soil organic matter content ({OM}\%) and C : N, but unrelated to the other studied environmental parameters ({pH}, redox, and above- and below-ground plant biomass). Partial correlation analysis, controlling for these environmental covariates, supported direct effects of salinity on the activity of carbon-degrading extracellular enzymes (β-1, 4-glucosidase, 1, 4-β-cellobiosidase, β-D-xylosidase, and phenol oxidase) as well as alkaline phosphatase, using a per unit {OM} basis. As enzyme activity is the putative rate-limiting step in decomposition, enhanced activity due to salinity increases could dramatically affect soil {OM} accumulation. Salinity was also found to be positively related to bacterial abundance ({qPCR} of the 16S {rRNA} gene) and tightly linked with community composition (T-{RFLP}). Furthermore, strong relationships were found between bacterial abundance and/or composition with the activity of specific enzymes (1, 4-β-cellobiosidase, arylsulfatase, alkaline phosphatase, and phenol oxidase) suggesting salinity's impact on decomposition could be due, at least in part, to its effect on the bacterial community. Together, these results indicate that salinity increases microbial decomposition rates in low salinity wetlands, and suggests that these ecosystems may experience decreased soil {OM} accumulation, accretion, and carbon sequestration rates even with modest levels of saltwater intrusion.},

Although salinization is known to have a great influence on biogeochemical processes, literature shows contrasting effects that challenge the prediction of future effects. In addition, the effects of fluctuating salinity levels, a more realistic scenario than constant levels, on nutrient cycling in coastal wetland sediments have hardly been examined. A better understanding is therefore crucial for the prediction of future effects and the definition of effective management. To test the effects of constantly brackish water (50 mmol Cl l−1, 3.2 psu) or fluctuating salinity (5–50 mmol Cl l−1), versus constantly low salinity (5 mmol Cl l−1, 0.32 psu) on nutrient biogeochemistry, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with either peat or clay sediments from coastal wetlands. Increased salinity showed to have a fast and large effect. Sediment cation exchange appeared to be the key process explaining both a decrease in phosphorus availability (through calcium mobilization) and an increase in nitrogen availability, their extent being strongly dependent on sediment type. Supply of brackish water decreased surface water turbidity and inhibited sediment methane production but did not affect {CO}2 production. Constant and fluctuating salinity levels showed similar longer term effects on nutrient and carbon cycling. The contrasting effects of salinization found for nitrogen and phosphorus, and its effects on water turbidity indicate major ecological consequences for coastal wetlands and have important implications for water management and nature restoration.},

This diversity of wetland types and habitats provides for diverse biotic communities, many of which are specific to individual wetlands. This paper explores the prospects for southern Australian wetlands under modified water regime and salinity induced by climatic changes. Extended droughts predicted as a consequence of climate change (lower rainfall and higher temperatures) combined with human-induced changes to the natural hydrological regime will lead to reductions in the amount of water available for environmental and anthropogenic uses. Reduced runoff and river flows may cause the loss of some temporary wetland types that will no longer hold water long enough to support hydric communities. Species distributions will shift and species extinctions may result particularly across fragmented or vulnerable landscapes. Accumulation of salts in wetlands shift species-rich freshwater communities to species-poor salt tolerant communities. Wetlands will differ in ecological response to these changes as the salinity and drying history of each wetland will determine its resilience: in the short term some freshwater communities may recover but they are unlikely to survive and reproduce under long term increased salinity and altered hydrology. In the long term such salinized wetlands with altered hydrology will need to be colonized by salt tolerant species adapted for the new hydrological conditions if they are to persist as functional wetlands. As the landscape becomes more developed, to accommodate the need for water in a warmer drying climate, increasing human intervention will result in a net loss of wetlands and wetland diversity.},

The objective of this study was to determine ecosystem responses to elevated salinity and increased water inputs, which are likely as sea level rise accelerates and saltwater intrudes into freshwater habitats. Since June 2008, in situ manipulations in a Zizaniopsis miliacea (giant cutgrass)-dominated tidal freshwater marsh in South Carolina have raised porewater salinities from freshwater to oligohaline levels and/or subtly increased the amount of water flowing through the system. Ecosystem-level fluxes of {CO}2 and {CH}4 have been measured to quantify rates of production and respiration. During the first 20 months of the experiment, the major impact of elevated salinity was a depression of plant productivity, whereas increasing freshwater inputs had a greater effect on rates of ecosystem {CO}2 emissions, primarily due to changes in soil processes. Net ecosystem production, the balance between gross ecosystem production and ecosystem respiration, decreased by 55\% due to elevated salinity, increased by 75\% when freshwater inputs were increased, and did not change when salinity and hydrology were both manipulated. These changes in net ecosystem production may impact the ability of marshes to keep up with rising sea levels since the accumulation of organic matter is critical in allowing tidal freshwater marshes to build soil volume. Thus, it is necessary to have regional-scale predictions of saltwater intrusion and water level changes relative to the marsh surface in order to accurately forecast the long-term sustainability of tidal freshwater marshes to future environmental change.},

We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175–299g-Cm−2yr−1 as {CO}2 and 3.3g-Cm−2yr−1 as {CH}4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84–283g-Cm−2yr−1 of {CO}2 from the atmosphere and released 2.5–6.6g-Cm−2yr−1 as {CH}4. The rice paddy evaporated 45–95\% more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net {CO}2 sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence.},

	abstract = {Agricultural drainage of organic soils has resulted in vast soil subsidence and contributed to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2) concentrations. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained over a century ago for agriculture and human settlement and has since experienced subsidence rates that are among the highest in the world. It is recognized that drained agriculture in the Delta is unsustainable in the long-term, and to help reverse subsidence and capture carbon (C) there is an interest in restoring drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. However, flooding may increase methane ({CH}4) emissions. We conducted a full year of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at two conventional drained agricultural peatlands (a pasture and a corn field) and three flooded land-use types (a rice paddy and two restored wetlands) to assess the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes in the Delta. We found that the drained sites were net C and greenhouse gas ({GHG}) sources, releasing up to 341 g C m−2 yr−1 as {CO}2 and 11.4 g C m−2 yr−1 as {CH}4. Conversely, the restored wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric {CO}2, sequestering up to 397 g C m−2 yr−1. However, they were large sources of {CH}4, with emissions ranging from 39 to 53 g C m−2 yr−1. In terms of the full {GHG} budget, the restored wetlands could be either {GHG} sources or sinks. Although the rice paddy was a small atmospheric {CO}2 sink, when considering harvest and {CH}4 emissions, it acted as both a C and {GHG} source. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the restored sites inhibited ecosystem respiration, making them net {CO}2 sinks. This study suggests that converting drained agricultural peat soils to flooded land-use types can help reduce or reverse soil subsidence and reduce {GHG} emissions.},

At present over 140 sites are operating on a long-term and continuous basis. Vegetation under study includes temperate conifer and broadleaved (deciduous and evergreen) forests, tropical and boreal forests, crops, grasslands, chaparral, wetlands, and tundra. Sites exist on five continents and their latitudinal distribution ranges from 70°N to 30°S. {FLUXNET} has several primary functions. First, it provides infrastructure for compiling, archiving, and distributing carbon, water, and energy flux measurement, and meteorological, plant, and soil data to the science community. (Data and site information are available online at the {FLUXNET} Web site, http://www-eosdis.ornl.gov/{FLUXNET}/.) Second, the project supports calibration and flux intercomparison activities. This activity ensures that data from the regional networks are intercomparable. And third, {FLUXNET} supports the synthesis, discussion, and communication of ideas and data by supporting project scientists, workshops, and visiting scientists. The overarching goal is to provide information for validating computations of net primary productivity, evaporation, and energy absorption that are being generated by sensors mounted on the {NASA} Terra satellite. Data being compiled by {FLUXNET} are being used to quantify and compare magnitudes and dynamics of annual ecosystem carbon and water balances, to quantify the response of stand-scale carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities to controlling biotic and abiotic factors, and to validate a hierarchy of soil–plant–atmosphere trace gas exchange models. Findings so far include 1) net {CO}2 exchange of temperate broadleaved forests increases by about 5.7 g C m−2 day−1 for each additional day that the growing season is extended; 2) the sensitivity of net ecosystem {CO}2 exchange to sunlight doubles if the sky is cloudy rather than clear; 3) the spectrum of {CO}2 flux density exhibits peaks at timescales of days, weeks, and years, and a spectral gap exists at the month timescale; 4) the optimal temperature of net {CO}2 exchange varies with mean summer temperature; and 5) stand age affects carbon dioxide and water vapor flux densities.},

Here, we provide a coherent assessment of the climate footprint of a network of wetland sites based on simultaneous and quasi-continuous ecosystem observations of {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes. Experimental areas are located both in natural and in managed wetlands and cover a wide range of climatic regions, ecosystem types, and management practices. Based on direct observations we predict that sustained {CH}4 emissions in natural ecosystems are in the long term (i.e., several centuries) typically offset by {CO}2 uptake, although with large spatiotemporal variability. Using a space-for-time analogy across ecological and climatic gradients, we represent the chronosequence from natural to managed conditions to quantify the “cost” of {CH}4 emissions for the benefit of net carbon sequestration. With a sustained pulse–response radiative forcing model, we found a significant increase in atmospheric forcing due to land management, in particular for wetland converted to cropland. Our results quantify the role of human activities on the climate footprint of northern wetlands and call for development of active mitigation strategies for managed wetlands and new guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ({IPCC}) accounting for both sustained {CH}4 emissions and cumulative {CO}2 exchange.},

In this study, we used the eddy covariance technique to measure surface energy carbon fluxes from a constructed, impounded freshwater wetland during two annual periods that were 8 years apart: 2002–2003 and 2010–2011. During 2010–2011, we measured methane ({CH}4) fluxes to quantify the annual atmospheric carbon mass balance and its concomitant influence on global warming potential ({GWP}). Peak growing season fluxes of latent heat and carbon dioxide ({CO}2) were greater in 2002–2003 compared to 2010–2011. In 2002, the daily net ecosystem exchange reached as low as −10.6 g C m−2 d−1, which was greater than 3 times the magnitude observed in 2010 (−2.9 g C m−2 d−1). {CH}4 fluxes during 2010–2011 were positive throughout the year and followed a strong seasonal pattern, ranging from 38.1 mg C m−2 d−1 in the winter to 375.9 mg C m−2 d−1 during the summer. The results of this study suggest that the wetland had reduced gross ecosystem productivity in 2010–2011, likely due to the increase in dead plant biomass (standing litter) that inhibited the generation of new vegetation growth. In 2010–2011, there was a net positive {GWP} (675.3 g C m−2 yr−1), and when these values are evaluated as a sustained flux, the wetland will not reach radiative balance even after 500 years.},

In this analysis, we replicated the measurements of {CH}4 flux using the eddy covariance technique at three tower locations within the same wetland site to parse the spatiotemporal variability in {CH}4 flux contributed by large-scale seasonal variations in climate and phenology and short-term variations in flux footprint movement over a mosaic of vegetation and open water. Using a hierarchical statistical model accounting for site-level environmental effects, tower-level footprint and biological effects, and temporal autocorrelation, we partitioned the key drivers of the daily {CH}4 flux variability among the three replicated towers. The daily mean air temperature and mean friction velocity, a measure of momentum transfer, explained a significant variability in {CH}4 flux across the three towers, and the abundance and spatial aggregation of vegetation in the flux footprint along with the daily gross primary productivity explained much of the tower-level variability. This statistical model captured 67\% of the total variance in the daily integrated growing season {CH}4 fluxes at this site, which bridged an order of magnitude from 80 to 480 mg C m−2 d−1 during the measurement period from 10 May 2012 to 24 October 2012.},

Using existing {GHG} fluxes measurements for the Delta and biogeochemical models, we estimated {GHG} emissions for a range of scenarios, including the status quo, modified groundwater management, and incorporating rice and managed wetlands. For current land uses, emissions were predicted to vary greatly (48,000 to 105,000 t {CO}2-e yr− 1) with varying groundwater depth. {GHG} emissions were highest when water depth was 120 cm, the typical depth for a Delta island, and lowest if water table depth was shallowest (60 cm). In the alternate land-use scenarios, we simulated wetlands and rice cultivation in areas of highest organic-matter soils, greatest subsidence, and {GHG} emissions. For each scenario, we analyzed economic implications for the land-owner by determining profit changes relative to the status quo. We spatially assigned areas for rice and wetlands, and then allowed the Delta Agricultural Production ({DAP}) model to optimize the allocation of other crops to maximize profit. The scenario that included wetlands decreased profits 79\% relative to the status quo but reduced {GHG} emissions by 43,000 t {CO}2-e yr− 1 (57\% reduction). When mixtures of rice and wetlands were introduced, farm profits decreased 16\%, and the {GHG} emission reduction was 33,000 t {CO}2-e yr− 1 (44\% reduction). When rice was cultivated on 38\% of the island, profit increased 12\% and emissions were 22,000 t {CO}2-e yr− 1 lower than baseline emissions (30\% reduction). Conversion to a mosaic of wetlands and crops including rice could substantially reduce overall {GHG} emissions of cultivated lands in the Delta without greatly affecting profitability.},

The approach considers the output of two {GCMs}, the {PCM} and the {HadCM}3, run under two different greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emission scenarios: the high emission A1fi and the low emission B1. The {GCM} output was statistically downscaled and used in the Variable Infiltration Capacity ({VIC}) macroscale distributed hydrologic model to derive inflows to major reservoirs in the California Central Valley. Historical inflows used as inputs to the water resources model {CalSim} {II} were modified to represent the climate change perturbed conditions for water supply deliveries, reliability, reservoir storage and changes to variables of environmental concern. Our results show greater negative impacts to California hydrology and water resources than previous assessments of climate change impacts in the region. These impacts, which translate into smaller streamflows, lower reservoir storage and decreased water supply deliveries and reliability, will be especially pronounced later in the 21st Century and south of the San Francisco bay Delta. The importance of considering how climate change impacts vary for different temporal, spatial, and institutional conditions in addition to the average impacts is also demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Water is a limited and valuable resource in California. A large proportion of the fresh water for southern California is supplied by the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. With recent efforts to restore large areas of land in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta region from farmland to managed wetlands, it is important to investigate the effect of wetland restoration on the local water cycle. We measured evapotranspiration using the eddy covariance method over six different sites in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta from 2013 to 2016. The three restored wetlands sites differed in time since restoration and wetland structure, i.e. the area of open water compared to closed vegetation. The three agricultural sites were a flooded rice field, an alfalfa field, and a grazed cattle pasture. In most years, annual evapotranspiration was significantly lower at the drained agricultural sites, with 652 ± 131 mm (2 year average ± standard deviation, {SD}) for the pasture and 901 ± 24 mm (3 year average ± {SD}) for the alfalfa field, compared to the two open water wetlands, with 1091 ± 144 mm (4 year average ± {SD}) for the Mayberry wetland and 1140 ± 67 mm (3 year average ± {SD}) at the East End wetland. Annual evapotranspiration at the flooded rice site (975 ± 50 mm, 4 year average ± {SD}) or the closed vegetation wetland (West Pond wetland, 996 ± 63 mm, 4 year average ± {SD}) was not significantly different from the drained alfalfa site across individual years. Our analysis showed that the structural difference between the wetlands, specifically the fraction of open water compared to closed vegetation, has a large impact on evapotranspiration dynamics. Through analysis of normalized equilibrium evaporation and nighttime evapotranspiration measurements we deduced that evapotranspiration at the wetland with a low fraction of open water surfaces was almost entirely dominated by plant transpiration with very little contribution from evaporation, despite the fact that the site was flooded and water was readily available. Both evaporation and transpiration contributed substantially to evapotranspiration at the two wetlands with larger fraction of open water surfaces. At the closed canopy site evaporation from subcanopy water seemed to be inhibited through two mechanisms: first, the closed canopy prevented heating of the water column and led to significantly cooler water temperatures, which reduced surface vapor pressure. Second, the closed canopy decoupled the water surface from the atmosphere and inhibited turbulent transport of water vapor away from the water surface. Our results provide valuable insights into the water use in California wetlands and can inform decisions on how to maximize water conservation during wetland restoration.},

Experimental tests and ecosystem observations have demonstrated the important role density corrections play in accurately quantifying carbon dioxide ({\textbackslash}hbox \{{CO}\}\_\{2\})({\textbackslash}hbox \{{CO}\}\_\{2\}) fluxes, but less attention has been paid to evaluating these corrections for methane ({\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\})({\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}) fluxes. We measured {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} fluxes with open-path sensors over a suite of sites with contrasting {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} emissions and energy partitioning, including a pavement airfield, two negligible-flux ecosystems (drained alfalfa and pasture), and two high-flux ecosystems (flooded wetland and rice). We found that density corrections successfully re-zeroed fluxes in negligible-flux sites; however, slight overcorrection was observed above pavement. The primary impact of density corrections varied over negligible- and high-flux ecosystems. For negligible-flux sites, corrections led to greater than 100\% adjustment in daily budgets, while these adjustments were only 3–10\% in high-flux ecosystems. The primary impact to high-flux ecosystems was a change in flux diel patterns, which may affect the evaluation of relationships between biophysical drivers and fluxes if correction bias exists. Additionally, accounting for density effects to high-frequency {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} fluctuations led to large differences in observed {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} flux cospectra above negligible-flux sites, demonstrating that similar adjustments should be made before interpreting {\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{{CH}\}\_\{4\} cospectra for comparable ecosystems.

	abstract = {It is necessary to partition eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange into its offsetting gross fluxes, canopy photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration, to understand the biophysical controls on the net fluxes. And independent estimates of canopy photosynthesis (G) and ecosystem respiration (R) are needed to validate and parametrize carbon cycle models that are coupled with climate and ecosystem dynamics models. Yet there is a concern that carbon flux partitioning methods may suffer from spurious correlation because derived values of canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration both contain common information on net carbon fluxes at annual time scales. We hypothesized that spurious correlation among canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration can be minimized using day–night conditional sampling of {CO}2 exchange; daytime fluxes are dominated by photosynthesis and nighttime fluxes are dominated by respiration. To test this hypothesis, we derived explicit equations that quantify the degree of spurious correlation between photosynthesis and respiration. Theoretically, day and night samples of net carbon exchange share a different common variable, daytime ecosystem respiration, and the degree of spurious correlation depends upon the variance of this shared variable. We then applied this theory to ideal measurements of carbon exchange of over a vigorous, irrigated, and frequently harvested alfalfa field in the sunny and windy region of California, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where soil {CO}2 efflux is strong. In this case, we found that the correlation coefficient between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration was −0.79. This relatively high correlation between canopy photosynthesis and respiration was mostly real as the degree of spurious correlation was only −0.32. We then expanded this analysis to the {FLUXNET} database that spans a spectrum of climate and plant functional types. We found, on average, that the correlation between gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration, using day–night sampling, was close to minus one (−0.828±0.130). For perspective, a large fraction of this correlation was real, as the degree of spurious correlation (Eq. (22)) was −0.526. We conclude that the potential for spurious correlation between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration across the {FLUXNET} database was moderate. Looking across the database, we found that the least negative spurious correlations coefficients ({\textgreater}−0.3) were associated with seasonal deciduous forests. The most negative spurious correlations coefficients ({\textless}−0.7) were associated with evergreen forests found in boreal climates.},

	abstract = {A primary objective of the {NASA} Earth-Sun Exploration Technology Office is to understand the observed Earth climate variability, thus enabling the determination and prediction of the climate's response to both natural and human-induced forcing. We are currently developing a suite of computational tools that will allow researchers to calculate, from data, a variety of information-theoretic quantities such as mutual information, which can be used to identify relationships among climate variables, and transfer entropy, which indicates the possibility of causal interactions. Our tools estimate these quantities along with their associated error bars, the latter of which is critical for describing the degree of uncertainty in the estimates. This work is based upon optimal binning techniques that we have developed for piecewise-constant, histogram-style models of the underlying density functions. Two useful side benefits have already been discovered. The first allows a researcher to determine whether there exist sufficient data to estimate the underlying probability density. The second permits one to determine an acceptable degree of round-off when compressing data for efficient transfer and storage. We also demonstrate how mutual information and transfer entropy can be applied so as to allow researchers not only to identify relations among climate variables, but also to characterize and quantify their possible causal interactions.},

	abstract = {Applied Predictive Modeling covers the overall predictive modeling process, beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing, data splitting and foundations of model tuning. The text then provides intuitive explanations of numerous common and modern regression and classification techniques, always with an emphasis on illustrating and solving real data problems. The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on, real-life examples, and every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process. This multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a practitioner’s reference handbook, or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses. To that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the book’s R package.This text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to predictive models as well as a guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.},

	abstract = {Wetland restoration can mitigate aerobic decomposition of subsided organic soils, as well as re-establish conditions favorable for carbon storage. Rates of carbon storage result from the balance of inputs and losses, both of which are affected by wetland hydrology. We followed the effect of water depth (25 and 55 cm) on the plant community, primary production, and changes in two re-established wetlands in the Sacramento San-Joaquin River Delta, California for 9 years after flooding to determine how relatively small differences in water depth affect carbon storage rates over time. To estimate annual carbon inputs, plant species cover, standing above- and below-ground plant biomass, and annual biomass turnover rates were measured, and allometric biomass models for Schoenoplectus (Scirpus) acutus and Typha spp., the emergent marsh dominants, were developed. As the wetlands developed, environmental factors, including water temperature, depth, and {pH} were measured. Emergent marsh vegetation colonized the shallow wetland more rapidly than the deeper wetland. This is important to potential carbon storage because emergent marsh vegetation is more productive, and less labile, than submerged and floating vegetation. Primary production of emergent marsh vegetation ranged from 1.3 to 3.2 kg of carbon per square meter annually; and, mid-season standing live biomass represented about half of the annual primary production. Changes in species composition occurred in both submerged and emergent plant communities as the wetlands matured. Water depth, temperature, and {pH} were lower in areas with emergent marsh vegetation compared to submerged vegetation, all of which, in turn, can affect carbon cycling and storage rates.},

	abstract = {Sulfate from seawater inhibits methane production in tidal wetlands, and by extension, salinity has been used as a general predictor of methane emissions. With the need to reduce methane flux uncertainties from tidal wetlands, eddy covariance ({EC}) techniques provide an integrated methane budget. The goals of this study were to: 1) establish methane emissions from natural, freshwater and brackish wetlands in Louisiana based on {EC}; and 2) determine if {EC} estimates conform to a methane-salinity relationship derived from temperate tidal wetlands with chamber sampling. Annual estimates of methane emissions from this study were 62.3 g {CH}4/m2/yr and 13.8 g {CH}4/m2/yr for the freshwater and brackish (8–10 psu) sites, respectively. If it is assumed that long-term, annual soil carbon sequestration rates of natural marshes are {\textasciitilde}200 g C/m2/yr (7.3 {tCO}2e/ha/yr), healthy brackish marshes could be expected to act as a net radiative sink, equivalent to less than one-half the soil carbon accumulation rate after subtracting methane emissions (4.1 {tCO}2e/ha/yr). Carbon sequestration rates would need case-by-case assessment, but the {EC} methane emissions estimates in this study conformed well to an existing salinity-methane model that should serve as a basis for establishing emission factors for wetland carbon offset projects.},

	abstract = {We present 6.5 years of eddy covariance measurements of fluxes of methane ({FCH}4) and carbon dioxide ({FCO}2) from a flooded rice paddy in Northern California, {USA}. A pronounced warming trend throughout the study associated with drought and record high temperatures strongly influenced carbon (C) budgets and provided insights into biophysical controls of {FCO}2 and {FCH}4. Wavelet analysis indicated that photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, {GEP}) induced the diel pattern in {FCH}4, but soil temperature (Ts) modulated its amplitude. Forward stepwise linear models and neural networking modeling were used to assess the variables regulating seasonal {FCH}4. As expected due to their competence in modeling nonlinear relationships, neural network models explained considerably more of the variance in daily average {FCH}4 than linear models. During the growing season, {GEP} and water levels typically explained most of the variance in daily average {FCH}4. However, Ts explained much of the interannual variability in annual and growing season {CH}4 sums. Higher Ts also increased the annual and growing season ratio of {FCH}4 to {GEP}. The observation that the {FCH}4 to {GEP} ratio scales predictably with Ts may help improve global estimates of {FCH}4 from rice agriculture. Additionally, Ts strongly influenced ecosystem respiration, resulting in large interannual variability in the net C budget at the paddy, emphasizing the need for long-term measurements particularly under changing climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of methane ({CH}4) emissions is of paramount importance because {CH}4 has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) and is currently the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Wetlands are the single largest natural {CH}4 source with median emissions from published studies of 164 Tg yr−1, which is about a third of total global emissions. We provide a perspective on important new frontiers in obtaining a better understanding of {CH}4 dynamics in natural systems, with a focus on wetlands. One of the most exciting recent developments in this field is the attempt to integrate the different methodologies and spatial scales of biogeochemistry, molecular microbiology, and modeling, and thus this is a major focus of this review. Our specific objectives are to provide an up-to-date synthesis of estimates of global {CH}4 emissions from wetlands and other freshwater aquatic ecosystems, briefly summarize major biogeophysical controls over {CH}4 emissions from wetlands, suggest new frontiers in {CH}4 biogeochemistry, examine relationships between methanogen community structure and {CH}4 dynamics in situ, and to review the current generation of {CH}4 models. We highlight throughout some of the most pressing issues concerning global change and feedbacks on {CH}4 emissions from natural ecosystems. Major uncertainties in estimating current and future {CH}4 emissions from natural ecosystems include the following: (i) A number of important controls over {CH}4 production, consumption, and transport have not been, or are inadequately, incorporated into existing {CH}4 biogeochemistry models. (ii) Significant errors in regional and global emission estimates are derived from large spatial-scale extrapolations from highly heterogeneous and often poorly mapped wetland complexes. (iii) The limited number of observations of {CH}4 fluxes and their associated environmental variables loosely constrains the parameterization of process-based biogeochemistry models.},
